                            <p>The notion of change occurs with all systems. As real people are involved in the processes of change, disputes occur, opinions vary, and even when aiming for the same outcome, approaches may differ. In order evolve and endure in the long term - Decred has engineered solutions of adaptability into it’s system. Whether an emergency, conflict or simply system updates - these solutions facilitate agreement and maintain a unified community during the process.</p>

                                <p>Decred empowers those who opt-in to the governance system with sovereignty over their money. In exchange for time-locking their coins, stakers acquire tickets that allow them to collectively determine the policy, development plan, budget, changes to the consensus rules.</p>

                                <p>Participants interact with the blockchain in two ways, the first of which is voting to approve each mined block. Five tickets are pseudorandomly selected from the ticket pool for each block. These tickets vote for or against the mined block, ensuring good mining behavior and earning part of the block reward.</p>

                                <p>Ticket holders also vote on-chain on changes to the consensus rules to upgrade the protocol. This process allows stakeholders to actively participate in determing the future of Decred. This builds cohesion by  keeping away the type of social conflicts and hard forks that fracture communities. </p>

                            <p class="text-block-7">Politeia - The Proposal System</p>
                            <p>As Decred takes steps towards operating as a Decentralized Autonomous Entity, the Politeia Proposal System plays a vital role, endowing the stakeholders with sovereignty to manage the spending of Decred’s Treasury and Decred’s policy. Proposals to date include new software features, marketing expenditures, partner integrations, contractor management, bug bounty, and research. Politeia is a governance platform that uses dcrtime to cryptographically verify identities and record all activity, managing the submission, discussion and voting of proposals. Proposals are submitted for a small fee, reviewed for spam and completeness, then published for discussion by the community. This process allows proposals to be iterated and refined before the owner authorizes voting to begin.</p>

                            <p>When voting is started, a snap picture of the ticket pool is taken to determine voting eligibility, and ticket holders have roughly one week to vote. Once a proposal passes, the owner is authorized to begin work, knowing their efforts are supported by the community and financed by the Treasury.</p>
