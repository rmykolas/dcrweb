                                <p>In peer-to-peer financial systems, Proof-of-Work solved the double spending problem. It has proved its worth for more than a decade, but is energy intensive and susceptible to majority attacks. Proof-of-Stake was developed to avoid those issues through alignment of interests, but it came with its own shortcomings, most notably the nothing at stake problem.</p>

                                <p class="text-block-7">Decred’s Hybrid Solution</p>
                                <p>Decred employs a combination of PoW and PoS to yield the best of both systems, mitigate their weaknesses, and deliver a layered consensus mechanism that makes it far more secure than other cryptocurrencies. Decred uses conventional PoW, typically mined by ASICs using the Blake-256 hash algorithm, for which it is dominant. Decred holders time-lock their funds to purchase tickets. Those tickets are added to a pool of roughly 41,000 tickets, and five tickets are pseudorandomly selected to validate the proof-of-work for each block. If at least 50% of the tickets approve the work of the miner, the block is approved and added to the blockchain. </p>

                                <p class="text-block-7">Resistance to Attacks</p>
                                <p>Because a block must include 3 or more ticket votes to be valid, blocks must be broadcast on the network as they are mined for the chain to proceed, so miners cannot mine in secret.  The result is that an attacker must have a considerable combination of hashpower and stake to successfully execute a majority attack. Decred voters are also set to reject a reorg of greater than 6 blocks, so any attack involving a deep reorg is unlikely to be accepted by the network. When comparing the cost of an attack on Decred to that of a pure PoW cryptocurrency, the cost to attack Decred is an order of magnitude greater, plus any attacker with stake would be taking actions counter to their interests. </p>
